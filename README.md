There is also a config for slowing down tree growth that is in the works of development.

###Credits
This mod was originally made because of Parcel31u's desire for configs in his mod pack, *[Material Energy^Natural Capital](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/material-energy-natural-capital)*, as a way to control certain aspects of the game. He is to be credited for some of the ideas that he has gave me to add to the mod.     
    
Credit is also due to Codyrule040 for providing me with ideas to be added to the mod as well.
